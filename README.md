# Advanced-Selector-0.5.1

A mod for using color selectors to kill bibites with certain gene ranges. Made with Bepinex.

This mod was made using version 0.5.1. It may work on versions past 0.5.1, but it may not.

To Install:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html">Install Bepinex into your copy of The Bibites</a> (Don't forget to run the game once to generate the config files.)</li>
<li>Download AdvancedSelector.dll and place it in the BepInEx/plugins folder.</li>
</ul>

To use the mod, put the gene name or the gene's index number in the gene input, exactly as it appears in game (but not case sensitive), and put the minimum and maximum values for the selector in the min and max inputs. The selector will kill bibites with a gene value in between the min and max values, inclusive. When "most" is active, it will kill the bibite closest to the center value between the min and max.
